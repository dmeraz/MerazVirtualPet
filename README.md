# MerazVirtualPet
Basil is a friendly, garden hedgehog that you can care for as your pet.
If you can get all of his levels to 10, he's yours for good!
If any of his levels drop to zero, he runs away.

#Components

Program.cs introduces user to Basil, explains the game, and calls Tick Method to track Basil's levels using case switch.
Exit feature included.
